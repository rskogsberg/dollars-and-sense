            employers, Lea Ann’s expertise includes strategy and implementation for recruiting higher

            counsel to the Elmhurst Symphony Orchestra’s successful, six-month

            missions of nonprofits. Her primary constituencies were corporations and foundations. She has
            developed many enduring relationships through her professional and volunteer
